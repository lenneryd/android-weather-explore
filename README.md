# Weather Explore
This is an Android app built to explore some Jetpack Compose functionality, how it interacts with things like Google Maps and AndroidX Navigation etc. 

### Features
- Jetpack Compose
- Compose Navigation Destinations
- Google Maps Compose
- Github Actions build setup

### Secrets
As the app is not meant for any sort of Play Store release I have kept the secrets needed to build release versions of the app local.
You can provide your own keystore or Google Maps key if you want to build the app in release mode and run it yourself.
